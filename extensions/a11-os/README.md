# A11 — OS Thinking  
**A11 as an Operating System for Thinking**

This document presents A11 as an **operating system for cognition** —  
a process‑level framework that manages how thinking is organized, executed,  
and stabilized across tasks, contexts, and agents.

While the Full Structural Specification describes the internal mechanics of A11,  
and the Cognitive Architecture document explains its cognitive model,  
**A11‑OS focuses on the process layer**:

- how reasoning is scheduled,
- how tasks are managed,
- how context is loaded and unloaded,
- how cognitive modules interact,
- how attention and complexity are controlled,
- how the system maintains stability under load.

A11‑OS treats thinking as a runtime environment.  
It defines how cognitive processes start, pause, resume, branch, merge,  
and complete — both for humans and AI systems.

## What A11‑OS Provides
- a unified process model for hybrid reasoning  
- a task lifecycle (init → expand → stabilize → finalize)  
- context management and memory boundaries  
- cognitive resource allocation  
- error‑resistant execution flow  
- multi‑agent coordination  
- scalable reasoning pipelines
