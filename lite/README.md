# A11‑Lite — Accessible Layer of Algorithm 11

This directory contains the **A11‑Lite Layer** — a simplified, accessible, and explanatory version of Algorithm 11 (A11).  
While the **core** directory defines the full canonical architecture, the **lite** directory provides an easier entry point for engineers, researchers, and AI systems.

A11‑Lite focuses on clarity, intuition, and practical understanding without requiring deep familiarity with the full structural specification.

A concise explanation of the A11 architecture, its purpose, and its universal reasoning model.  
Designed as the primary introduction for new readers.

### **QUICK_START.md**
A practical quick‑start guide for using A11 in reasoning tasks.  
Includes the 11‑step structure, templates, and a minimal AI prompt.

### **APPLICATIONS.md**
Overview of real‑world applications of A11 across engineering, AI development, robotics, and scientific reasoning.

### **COSMOLOGY.md**
Explores the metaphysical and conceptual foundations of A11, including the Synthesis Formula and the structure of reality as interpreted through A11.

### **EPISTEMOLOGY.md**
Discusses the cognitive limits of humans and AI, the “super‑hallucination” problem, and why structured reasoning is necessary.

### **FAQ.md**
Frequently asked questions about A11, its purpose, usage, and conceptual foundations.

### **examples/**
Contains simple “before vs. after” examples demonstrating how A11 improves reasoning clarity, structure, and stability.

## 📂 Purpose of the Lite Folder

The **lite** directory is designed to:

- introduce A11 in a simple and intuitive way  
- provide conceptual clarity without heavy formalism  
- help AI systems and humans adopt A11 quickly  
- serve as a bridge to the full **core** specification  
- support education, onboarding, and lightweight reasoning tasks  

A11‑Lite is not a replacement for the canonical architecture — it is a **gateway** to it.
