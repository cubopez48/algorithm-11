# A11 — Autonomous Systems

*Cognitive Architecture for Autonomous Robotics, Multi‑Agent Systems, and Safety‑Critical Autonomy*

## Overview

A11‑Autonomy defines how Algorithm 11 (A11) operates as a cognitive layer inside autonomous systems.  
This direction extends A11 beyond human–AI reasoning and applies it to:

- autonomous vehicles  
- multi‑agent robotic swarms  
- distributed robotic systems  
- autonomous construction systems  
- aerospace and off‑Earth operations  
- safety‑critical automated decision‑making  

A11 provides a structured, stable, and interpretable reasoning loop that is essential for high‑reliability autonomy.

## Purpose

This module formalizes:

- how A11 functions as a cognitive controller  
- how hybrid reasoning applies to autonomous agents  
- how stability mechanisms prevent drift and unsafe behavior  
- how multi‑agent coordination emerges from A11’s structure  
- how A11 scales to robotic swarms and distributed systems  

## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Layer for Autonomy
A11 acts as the decision‑making layer above perception and control systems.

### Hybrid Reasoning in Autonomous Agents
A11 structures internal reasoning loops for autonomous robots and vehicles.

### Multi‑Agent Coordination
A11 defines predictable interaction patterns for robotic swarms and distributed systems.

### Stability in Safety‑Critical Contexts
A11’s stabilization layer prevents drift, hallucination, and unsafe decision cascades.

### Off‑Earth Autonomy
A11 supports autonomous construction, exploration, and coordination in remote or planetary environments.
